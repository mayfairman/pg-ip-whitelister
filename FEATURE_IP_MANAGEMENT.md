# IP Management Feature

This document describes the new IP management feature added to the PG IP Whitelister application.

## Overview

The IP Management feature allows users to view and manage whitelisted IP addresses for each resource through a user-friendly modal interface. Users can:

- View all currently whitelisted IP addresses for a resource
- Remove individual IP addresses  
- Remove all IP addresses at once
- Replace all IP addresses with their current IP

## Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### New API Endpoints

1. **DELETE /api/resource/{resource_id}/rule/{rule_id}**
   - Deletes a specific rule from a resource
   - Used for removing individual IP addresses

2. **DELETE /api/resource/{resource_id}/ip-rules**
   - Deletes all IP whitelist rules from a resource
   - Filters to only remove IP ACCEPT rules

3. **PUT /api/resource/{resource_id}/replace-ip-whitelist**
   - Replaces all IP whitelist rules with the current user's IP
   - Combines delete all + add current IP in one atomic operation

#### New PangolinAPI Methods

- `delete_rule(resource_id, rule_id)` - Delete a specific rule
- `delete_all_ip_rules(resource_id)` - Delete all IP whitelist rules
- `replace_ip_whitelist(resource_id, ip)` - Replace all rules with one IP

### Frontend Changes

#### New UI Components

- **Manage IPs Button**: Added to each resource card for easy access
- **IP Management Modal**: Full-featured modal with:
  - List of currently whitelisted IPs
  - Current IP indicator
  - Individual remove buttons for each IP
  - Bulk action buttons (Remove All, Replace with Current IP)
  - Loading states and error handling

#### New JavaScript Functions

- `openManageIPs(resource)` - Opens the management modal
- `loadIPRules()` - Fetches and displays IP rules for the resource
- `deleteIP(ipRule)` - Removes a specific IP address
- `deleteAllIPs()` - Removes all IP addresses with confirmation
- `replaceWithCurrentIP()` - Replaces all IPs with current IP
- `updateResourceWhitelistStatus()` - Updates main page status after changes

## User Experience

### Workflow

1. **View IPs**: Click "Manage IPs" button on any resource card
2. **Remove Individual IP**: Click the red "Remove" button next to any IP
3. **Remove All IPs**: Click "Remove All" button (with confirmation dialog)
4. **Replace with Current**: Click "Replace with Current IP" button (with confirmation dialog)

### Visual Feedback

- **Current IP Highlighting**: User's current IP is marked with a green "Current" badge
- **Loading States**: Spinners shown during operations
- **Real-time Updates**: Resource status updates immediately after changes
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for any failures
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: User confirmation required for destructive operations

## Security Considerations

- All endpoints validate resource and rule IDs
- IP address validation using existing `validate_ip_address()` function
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- Operations are logged for audit purposes
- Consistent error handling patterns with existing code

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite added covering:

- All new API endpoints (success and failure cases)
- Input validation (invalid IDs, malformed data)
- PangolinAPI methods with mocked dependencies
- Edge cases (no rules found, delete failures)

**Test Coverage**: 19 tests all passing

## API Usage Examples

### Delete a specific IP rule
```bash
DELETE /api/resource/123/rule/456
```

### Delete all IP rules for a resource
```bash
DELETE /api/resource/123/ip-rules
```

### Replace all IP rules with current IP
```bash
PUT /api/resource/123/replace-ip-whitelist
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "ip": "192.168.1.100"
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Bulk IP Addition**: Allow adding multiple IPs at once
2. **IP Range Support**: Support for CIDR notation ranges
3. **Rule Expiration**: Time-based automatic rule removal
4. **Rule Comments**: Add descriptions to IP rules
5. **Export/Import**: Backup and restore IP whitelists

## Dependencies

This feature reuses existing infrastructure:

- Existing Pangolin API integration
- Current IP detection logic
- Resource fetching and status checking
- Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS for UI
- Existing error handling and logging patterns

No new external dependencies were added.
